# Exercises from 4.10.2016

1. Write a program that prints the `largest` element in an array, e.g. `[2, 5, 3, 1] -> 5`
2. Write program that prints the array but `reversed`, e.g. `[1, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 1]`
3. Write a program that checks whether an `element occurs` in an array, e.g. `[2, 5, 4], 5 -> true`
4. Write a program that `combines two arrays` by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. `[a,b,c], [1,2,3] -> [a,1,b,2,c,3]`.
5. Write a program that calculates the list of the first `100 Fibonacci numbers`.
6. Write a program that takes a number (as string) and returns an array containing its digits, e.g. `"1234" -> ["1", "2", "3", "4"]`
7. Modify the previous program to receive the number as an `integer`, e.g. `567 -> [5, 6, 7]`
