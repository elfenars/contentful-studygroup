# Ruby Stars study group

In this repository you will find all the examples of the different topics, which were written during the lessons, as well as some proposed exercises together with its solutions.

## Examples from the lessons
### `Methods`
Contains examples about how to create methods, how to send data through parameters and how to use them.

### `Methods-Conditionals`
Contains examples on how `if` and `else` work as well as additional examples on methods together with scopes.

### `Loops`
Contains examples on the use of the instructions `for` and `while` and how to use them to move through an array to access all the elements if there is no knowledge of how many elements it contains.

### `Operators`
Examples on how relational (comparison) operators work in numbers as well as examples on how to use assignment operators to make lines shorter (`i = i + 1 -> i += 1`)

## Proposed exercises
### `Exercises-27.9.2016`
First set of additional exercises. With solutions discussed during the lesson.

General topics for solving the tasks:
* Use of loops
* Use of `if` statements
* Recap on arrays and operations that can be performed with them

### `Exercises-4.10.2016`
Second set of additional exercises. Solutions added (built by coaches).

General topics for solving the tasks:
* Use of comparison and mathematical operators
* Use of loops
* Use of `if` statements
* Operations with arrays (check the Ruby documentation for insights and hints)
