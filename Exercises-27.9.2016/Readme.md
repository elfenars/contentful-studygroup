1. Write a program that receives one number and prints wether that number is an `even` or `odd` number.
2. Modify the previous program and print if the number is a `prime` number.
3. Write a program that prints all the numbers from `1 to 100`.
4. Modify the previous program and for `multiples of 3`, instead of the number, print `Fizz`, for `multiples of 5` print `Buzz`.
5. Write a program that receives two Arrays as parameters, merges them into one Array and prints the size of the merged Array.
6. Write a program that receives one Array as parameter, if the size of the Array is `lower than 10 elements`, print the array. * If `it’s bigger than 10 elements`, only take the `first 10 elements` and print the Array.
7. Write a program that takes 2 parameters, a number and an operation. The operation can be `“sum”` or `“multiply”`. Depending on the specified operation, calculate it from 1...n.
  + If I pass `3` as number and  `“sum”` as operation, the function should calculate `1+2+3`.
  + If I pass `3` as number and  `“multiply”` as operation, the function should calculate `1*2*3`.
